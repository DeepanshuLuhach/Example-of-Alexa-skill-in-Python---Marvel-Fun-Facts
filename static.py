	"black widow" : [
		"Similar to Black Panther, the name Black Widow appears to be more of a title rather than a superhero name unique to one person. It comes from the secret USSR Black Widow program that Romanoff trained in, so it is unclear if the name is unique to her or if it is given to every graduate of the program.",
		"In 1975, Stan Lee gave the rights of Black Widow and Daredevil to none other than Angela Bowie, the then-wife of David Bowie, to develop a television series with the characters. At the end of the day, the show didn’t go forward, but photos do exist of Angela and Ben Carruthers (who was set to play Daredevil) in Black Widow and Daredevil costumes, respectively.",
		"Apparently, even trained Russian spies have dreams of living normal lives too. There was once a comic book storyline that saw Black Widow and Daredevil–then in a relationship–move to San Francisco and live normal lives. During this time, Natasha wanted to become a fashion designer.",
		"Everyone knew that sooner or later Black Widow’s past would come back to haunt her, and it did in the form of Yelena Belova. In the late 1990s, Belova appeared in the comics, revealing that she trained in the same program as Romanoff and was sent to kill her to become the new Black Widow. After a hard fought battle, Romanoff was able to descramble Belova’s brain and bring her back to the good side.",
		"The release of Avengers: Infinity War later this year will mark the sixth MCU film Johansson physically appears in as Black Widow, and I say physically because she does show up on a monitor in Thor: Ragnarok, meaning she’s technically appeared in seven MCU films.",
		"Black Widow truly is a jack-of-all-trades when it comes to her line of work. Not only is she trained in various forms of martial arts and weaponry, but she also has numerous weapons at her disposal—like grappling hooks—and is a master manipulator.",
		"It took a few iterations of the Black Widow costume before comic fans got the one we know and love today. Aside from the gown and veil, she was also seen from time to time in fishnet stockings, a masquerade mask, a tight black leather dress and/or a tiny cape. It wasn’t until Amazing Spider-Man #86 in 1970 that Black Widow would appear in the black cat suit with long red hair.",
		"Everyone knows Black Widow by the black, leather-clad suit she wears in the Marvel films, but that wasn’t always her wardrobe. When she first debuted, she wore an evening gown and veil. Seriously. The fact that she still kicked butt shows you how much of a beast she was and still is!",
		"If there is one aspect of Black Widow’s back story that a fair amount of people know, it’s that she (thinks she) used to be a ballerina. However, what no one can agree on is if that part of her life is real or not. There are some who believe that the KGB implanted the ballerina memories in her head, while others think they’re real, and she used it as her cover while she was a spy. The comics are no help, so pick whichever one you prefer!",
		"There’s no denying Black Widow’s ability to take on any attackers solo, but sometimes she likes to lend her skills to whatever team is in need of some help. Black Widow has been a part of (and even led) numerous groups in the comics, from well known teams like The Avengers and SHIELD to lesser household names like Heroes for Hire, Lady Liberators, and Secret Avengers.",
		"Black Widow may not have been successful in her murder attempts in the original comic books, but the same cannot be said for Ultimate Marvel comics Black Widow. In this series, Black Widow kills Tony Stark’s butler Jarvis before going on to kill Hawkeye’s wife and kids! She eventually goes on to be killed by Hawkeye. In the films, their relationship is much different. They’re best friends, to the point where one of Hawkeye’s kids is named after Natasha, and in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, she wears an arrow pendant as a tribute to their friendship.",
		"Black Widow has dated multiple superheroes throughout her existence in the comics, but we have yet to see any full-blown romance for her in the films. The films haven’t delved too far into her past yet, but one relationship they have been building towards is one with Bruce Banner–AKA The Hulk. Interestingly, if they go through with it, this relationship would be a fresh, new pairing unique to the films and not seen in the comics.",
		"Romanoff may not have any real relation to the Black Widow spider itself, but she does have something in common with the widow aspect of her name: she is a widow herself. Although her ex-husband Alexei’s death was originally faked, he did end up dying for real later on.",
		"there were other actresses who Marvel looked at before going with Scarlett Johansson. The list included Eliza Dushku, Angelina Jolie, and Natalie Portman. Of course, Portman then went on to play Jane Foster in the Thor films.",
		"Like most movie roles, Black Widow had its fair share of actresses in line to play the character. Unlike most movie roles, however, the actress chosen for the part didn’t end up playing it in the end. Emily Blunt was originally cast as Black Widow and was ready to film Iron Man 2 when she had to back out because she was already working on Gulliver’s Travels and the filming schedules conflicted.",
		"Back in 2004, before Marvel Studios became what it is today, they were struggling. They sold the rights to Black Widow to Lionsgate, who planned on making a Black Widow film, and even had a script from X-Men writer David Hayter ready to go. But after female-led action movies bombed at the box office that year, Lionsgate pulled the plug on the film.",
		"Black Widow was forced to marry test pilot and Soviet Spy Alexei Shostakov, but eventually grew to love him over the years. However, when the KGB faked his death, Romanoff focused all of her attention on her work, which just so happened to be the Black Widow program.",
		"Not only did Black Widow date Barnes, but she also had relationships with Hawkeye—more on him later—Hercules, and Daredevil. It should be noted that most of these relationships were kind of business related, as Romanoff was trying to manipulate them to turn on their country or get intel from them at one point or another.",
		"Back when Romanoff was training in the Black Widow program, she had a teacher with a similar past to hers: Bucky Barnes. That’s right, back when Barnes was also brain washed by the Soviet Union, the Winter Soldier helped train Romanoff. They were even romantically involved for a period of time."

		"While most superheroes hide behind a secret identity, this isn’t the case for T’Challa. Black Panther is a title, not an alter-ego, and it’s passed down from protector to protector.",
		"Marvel decided it was best to change the name of a key character from the Black Panther comic who is featured in the film. The character of M’Baku is actually named Man-Ape in the comic, and is often covered in fur and wears an ape mask. I think it’s pretty clear why Marvel thought some viewers might have an issue with that.",
		"Executive Producer Nate Moore is cited as saying that Black Panther feels like a crossover between The Godfather and the James Bond franchise, bringing the family drama and competition for power to a world of espionage. Blade Runner has also been cited as inspiration for the design of Wakanda.",
		"Boseman decided that an African accent was not only appropriate, but also necessary for T’Challa. He believes that because Wakanda is a technologically advanced nation that was never affected by colonialism, Black Panther would keep his native tongue and not have a European accent.",
		"Coogler brought in experts on African history and politics to help set up and establish Wakanda and add legitimacy to the nation.",
		"When Daredevil decided he needed a break from protecting Hell’s Kitchen, he got Black Panther to fill in for him. During this time, whenever Black Panther wasn’t patrolling the streets, he went under the civilian name of Mr. Okonkwo, an immigrant from the Congo, and was the manager of the Devil’s Kitchen diner.",
		"Before Ryan Coogler was hired as the director of Black Panther, Ava DuVernay was in talks to direct the film and even met with Kevin Feige and Boseman to discuss it, but parted ways after creative differences. Other plans included a version directed by John Singleton–who wanted Chiwetel Ejiofor as the titular character–and F. Gary Gray.",
		"Before Chadwick Boseman became the King of Wakanda, Wesley Snipes did his best to claim the throne. Back in 1992, he expressed his intention to bring Black Panther to the big screen, and even had the backing of Lee. He fought hard for over a decade, but wasn’t able to get the deal done.",

		"Black Panther became one half of a true power couple when he married X-Men member Storm in his homeland of Wakanda. Unfortunately, after Wakanda was attacked, T’Challa realized he needed to focus more on being a king than a husband, and the marriage was annulled.",
		"Like any role in Hollywood, several actors auditioned for the role of Black Panther. Among them were Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Anthony Mackie, Djimon Hounsou, and John Boyega. Other than Boyega, these actors all still managed to land a role in the MCU, with Akinnuoye-Agbaje and Hounsou having parts in Thor: The Dark World and Guardians of the Galaxy, respectively, and Mackie playing Sam Wilson—aka Falcon—in numerous films. Don’t be sad for Boyega,though: he’s got a little thing called Star Wars.",
		"Black Panther wasn’t inspired by or named after the Black Panther movement that came in 1966, but actually debuted a few months before the group appeared. There was even a brief period when Marvel decided to change the character’s name to Black Leopard to avoid any assumed affiliation with the group, but neither Marvel nor the fans were too keen on the name, and Marvel changed it back.",
		"After years of being a featured player in other superheroes’ comics, Black Panther finally got the chance to star in his own when he headlined Jungle Action #5 in 1973.",

Eventually, the Falcon earned top billing alongside Cap, making him more of a partner than a sidekick. And, according to Marvel Senior Vice President of Publishing Tom Brevoort, he was \"the first super hero of color to get his own action figure back in the 1970s.\"",
		"In the tradition of superhero origin stories — Superman, Batman, Spiderman, etc. — the Falcon’s origin story begins with a young Sam Wilson being orphaned. In the comics, Sam Wilson grew up in Harlem, where his minister father was killed after attempting to break up a fight. His mother was killed in a mugging a few years later, leaving Sam alone.",
		"Not unlike the orphaned superheroes that came before him, the loss of his parents led Sam Wilson down a bad path before he eventually became the Falcon. It’s likely this origin story will never see the light of day in the MCU, and that’s a good thing. (We should also be thankful his mother’s name isn’t Martha.)",
		"Part of the Falcon’s original backstory was his dark past as Sam ‘Snap’ Wilson. Following the murders of his parents, Sam Wilson became a gangster with the aforementioned nickname. Though his character clearly had ties to the mob, it’s unclear what his role was exactly. Some say that he worked as a pimp, but that point has been debated.",

Although later stories have revealed that she was under the influence of other villains, it was her powers that were able to completely tear the team apart.",

Then she was trained by Agatha Harkness in witchcraft. She uses these magic abilities to hone her own mutant powers and control her hexes. ",

So, he decided to replace it with a black and white one which he found on an alien planet. But, the suit was not clothing; it was actually Venom's symbiote. ",

		"On April Fools’ Day 2015, Ryan Reynolds posted on Twitter that Deadpool would be rated PG-13 prompting a horrified backlash from fans who felt that a PG-13 film could not do the superhero justice. Later that day, Reynolds confirmed that it was a prank and that the film would be R-rated.",
